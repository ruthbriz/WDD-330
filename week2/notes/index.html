    <ul>
        <li> Strings ― string literals, string properties and methods</li>
        <li>Declaring and assigning constants and variables</li>
        <li>Numbers ― decimal, hexadecimal, octal, binary and exponent form, Infinity, and NaN</li>
        <li>Arithmetic operations such as +, -, *, /, and %</li>
        <li>Undefined and null</li>
        <li>Booleans ― truthy and falsy values</li>
        <li>Logical operators ― AND, OR, and NOT</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>const is used when the variable will not be reassigned to another value</li>
        <li>let is used if the variable might be reassigned later in the program.</li>
        <li>To assign a value to a constant or variable, we use the = operator.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>There are six primitive data types: Strings, Symbols, Numbers, Booleans, Undefined, and Null.</li>
        <li>Strings and numbers have various properties and methods that provide information about them.</li>
        <li>Symbols are unique, immutable values.</li>
        <li>Boolean values are either true or false.</li>
        <li>There are only seven values that are false in JavaScript and these are known as 'falsy' values.</li>
        <li>Data types can be converted into other data types.</li>
        <li>Logical operators can be used to check if compound statements are true or false.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>Arrays are an ordered list of values. Arrays have lots of methods that can be used to manipulate items in the array</li>
        <li>We can use an if and else statement to control the flow of code</li>
        <li>The switch statement can be used instead of multiple if and else statements</li>
        <li>A while loop and do ... while loop can be used to repeat a block of code while a condition is still true</li>
        <li>A for loop works in a similar way to a while loop, but has a different syntax</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>Functions are first-class objects that behave the same way as other values.</li>
        <li>Function literals can be defined using the function declaration, or by creating a function expression by assigning an anonymous function to a variable.</li>
        <li>All functions return a value. If this is not explicitly stated, the function will return undefined.</li>
        <li>A parameter is a value that is written in the parentheses of a function declaration and can be used like a variable inside the function’s body.</li>
        <li>An argument is a value that is provided to a function when it is invoked.</li>
        <li>The arguments variable is an array-like object that allows access to each argument provided to the function using index notation.</li>
        <li>The rest operator can be used to access multiple arguments as an array.</li>
        <li>Default arguments can be supplied to a function by assigning them to the parameters.</li>
        <li>Function declarations can be invoked before they are defined because they are hoisted to the top of the scope, but function expressions cannot be invoked until after they are defined.</li>
        <li>A callback is a function that is provided as an argument to another function.</li>
    </ul>
