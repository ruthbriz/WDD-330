    <ul>
        <li>When designing, do the mobile first because it is the most common gadget used today. Most people use phones rather than laptops or desktops.</li>
        <li>It is very important to make the website serviceable and make the user think less on what they are going to do.</li>
        <li>It is better to show what they came for rather showing different things that would make them frustrated and leave.</li>
        <li>It is better to use icons that are commonly use, because if a user does not know what to do, they would just look for another website.</li>
        <li>It is better to use small ads that would not block the userâ€™s view, it would make them frustrated and leave the website if they are bombarded with ads.</li>
