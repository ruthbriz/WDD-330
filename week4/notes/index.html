          <li>Forms are the primary method used for entering data into a browser.</li>
          <li>Forms have a variety of controls that are used for entering different types of information.</li>
          <li>document.forms will return an HTML collection of all the forms on a page.</li>
          <li>form.elements will return an HTML collection of all the elements contained within a form.</li>
          <li>Forms have focus, blur, and change events that fire as a user interacts with the form.</li>
          <li>Forms also have a submit event that can be used to intercept a form before it’s been submitted.</li>
          <li>The information entered into a form can be read or updated using the value property of the form controls.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>

        <ul>
          <li>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a way of programming that uses objects that encapsulate their own properties and methods.</li>
          <li>The main concepts of OOP are encapsulation, polymorphism and inheritance.</li>
          <li>Constructor functions can be used to create instances of objects.</li>
          <li>Inside a constructor function or class declaration, the keyword this refers to the object returned by the function.</li>
          <li>All instances of a class or constructor function inherit all the properties and methods of its prototype.</li>
          <li>The prototype is live, so new properties and methods can be added to existing instances.</li>
          <li>The prototype chain is used to find an available method. If an object lacks a method, JavaScript will check whether its prototype has the method. If not, it will check that function’s prototype until it finds the method or reaches the Object constructor function.</li>
          <li>Private properties and methods can be created by defining variables using const and defining a function inside a constructor function. These can be made public using getter and setter functions.</li>
          <li>Monkey-patching is the process of adding methods to built-in objects by augmenting their prototypes. This should be done with caution as it can cause unexpected behavior in the way built-in objects work.</li>
          <li>A mixin method can be used to add properties and methods from other objects without creating an inheritance chain.</li>
          <li>Methods can be chained together and called in sequence if they return a reference to this.</li>
          <li>Polymorphism allows objects to override shared methods with a more specific implementation.</li>
          <li>The value of this is not retained inside nested functions, which can cause errors. This can be worked around by using that = this, using the bind(this) method and using arrow functions.</li>
          <li>Methods can be borrowed from other objects.</li>
          <li>Composition over inheritance is a design pattern where objects are composed from 'building-block' objects, rather than inheriting all their properties and methods from a parent class.</li>
        </ul>

          <li>JavaScript libraries provide methods to make common tasks easier to achieve.</li>
          <li>Libraries can make programming much easier, but you should think carefully about whether you require a library, and which one is best for your needs.</li>
          <li>jQuery and Lodash are two popular libraries that provide a large number of useful and well-tested functions.</li>
          <li>npm and Yarn are package managers that can be used to install JavaScript packages, as well as any dependencies that they require.</li>
          <li>A module is a self-contained piece of code that provides functions and methods that can then be used in other files and by other modules.</li>
          <li>The MVC pattern is used to organize code into distinct sections that are responsible for different elements of an application.</li>
          <li>Template files can be used to separate view code from JavaScript; they also enable dynamic code and programming logic to be used to generate markup.</li>
          <li>React and Vue.js are popular JavaScript view libraries that render components and keep track of their state.</li>
          <li>Minification is the process of removing any redundant characters from the code in order to reduce its file size.</li>
          <li>Files can be compressed on the server using the gzip compression tool.</li>
          <li>Webpack can be used to bundle multiple files into a single bundle, and automate common tasks such as transpiling, minifying code and running tests.</li>
          <li>Before code is deployed, it should be concatenated into a single file, minified and compressed. The script tag should be placed just before the closing </body> tag to ensure that all elements on the page have loaded before the script runs.</li>
